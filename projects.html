                    <h3>Motor Control Panel</h3>
                    <p>Below is a project that involved designing the PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) code and HMI (Human Machine Interface) touchscreen
                    for a workshop test panel.<br><br>The panel included 8 motor drives that
                    could be ran individually in manual, or according to preset automatic modes.</p>
                    <img src="images/panel-home.png" alt="Panel Home" />
                    <p>When any of the drives were clicked on from the screen above, a more detailed display would show data for each drive.<br><br>
                    The same screen would generate for each group of drives, however different parameter lists would populate the display as appropriate depending on the drive chosen.</p>
                    <img src="images/panel-drives2.png" alt="Panel Drives 2" />
                    <p>Pressing the 'burger menu' icon in the top right corner would bring up the navigation menu from any screen within the interface - improving usability.</p>

                    <hr class="section-divider">

                    <h3>Box Sorter Simulation</h3>
                    <p>Here is a simulation project for a system that could detect different size boxes in an automated warehouse environment.<br><br>
                    I created and built the scenario with virtual equipment in simulation software, as can be seen below.</p>
                    <img src="images/conv-side.png" alt="Conv Side" />
                    <p>I then linked the simulation to PLC programming software, where the code for the automation was created.<br><br>
                    The HMI interface can be seen below, which offers full control over the system, offering automatic and manual modes.</p>
                    <img src="images/conv-hmi.png" alt="conv hmi" />
                    <p>When compared to the plan view below, the HMI layout mirrors the equipment accurately,
                    offering a potential end-user a clear and intuitive experience. </p>

                    <h3>PLC Code</h3>
                    <p>Below is an example of ladder logic, a section of graphical code written by myself for an automated system.<br><br>
                    It uses symbols and principles similar to schematic drawings but has a logical top-to-bottom layout.</p>
                    <img src="images/plc-code.png" alt="plc code" />
                    <p>When ladder logic is converted to structured text (also used with PLCs), similarities between other coding languages such as Python can be seen.</p>

                    <h3>Teaching</h3>
                    <p>During my time as a teacher, I created my own teaching materials that would cater to different learning styles<br><br>
                    The logo below was used on a previous website of mine, marketing my services as teacher and performing musician.</p>
                    <img src="images/demusic.jpg" alt="DE Music" />
                    <p>I created the tuition book seen here, which offered a progression towards graded music exams.
                    The book included access to self-written backing tracks available to download from my website.</p>
                    <img src="images/drum-book.jpg" alt="drum book" />
                    <p>Helpful visual diagrams and notation keys were included at the front of the book.</p>
                    <img src="images/drum-book2.jpg" alt="drum book 2" />
                    <p>The structure of the book involved shorter exercises that could be combined to challenge students,
                    eventually leading on to playing a full piece with a playalong track.</p>
                    <img src="images/drum-book3.jpg" alt="drum book 3" />
                    <p>The colour-coded system I built below assisted younger drummers to play while reading music.
                    The colours really helped to engage smaller children, but could be really useful for older pupils as well!</p>
